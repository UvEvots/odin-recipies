    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. 
        Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    Yields 8 servings.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</strong>: Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of 
            breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store. </li>
        <li><strong>1 cup buttermilk</strong>: Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. 
            Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken. </li>
        <li><strong>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, 
            while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust. </li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon paprika & salt and pepper to taste</strong>: This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. 
            You can add more spices and seasonings to taste. </li>
        <li><strong>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</strong>: Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point. </li>
    </ul>
